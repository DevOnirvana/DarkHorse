This is a project based on designing an online Aptitude Test Portal for Assessment of the Final year students in a mock environment.
It has been built with Node.Js as the back-end and handlebars as the front end templating engine. 
Some Twitter bootstrap is also used.
This website takes in the details of the students and registers them saving their data in the database.
It gives people an option to login to start the test and saves their scores for their future references.
Go to the directory and use npm install to install all the dependencies from the package.json.
Install Mongo Db on your system and start it using mongod.
start the nodeJs server.
reach the site on localhost:8000
